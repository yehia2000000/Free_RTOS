# Free_RTOS
Practice For Free RTOS

## Task: 
Design a healthcare system using RTOS with the following requirements:▪A touch LCD as input that can control the system and give commands. Every LCD command is represented in 4 bytes. LCD is connected to the micro-controller through UART with speed 9600 bps [Bit per second]. (Reading 4 bytes and processing the command takes 2 ms)▪Blood pressure sensor with new data every 25ms. (Reading the sensor and processing its data takes 3 ms)▪Heart beat detector with new data every 100ms. (Reading the sensor and processing its data takes 1.5 ms)▪Temperature sensor with new data every 10ms. (Reading the sensor and processing its data takes 2.5 ms)▪Alert siren. (Activate or Deactivate the siren takes 1 ms)Tasks

## Deliverables:
•Decide how many tasks are needed.
•Decide the task parameters (Priority – Periodicity – Deadline).•Decide the system tick rate.
•Calculate:▪Hyperperiod▪CPU load.
•Draw the timeline manually and analyze system schedulability.
•Model the system in Simso and verify that your design is schedulable.
•Provide a report with the above points using screenshots and comments on your results and analysis.Tasks
